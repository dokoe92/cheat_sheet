<!--
Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our example project, we documented the tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

HTML Tables
Other HTML tags
CSS selectors and specificity
Common CSS properties

------------

Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

The tag or attribute name
The actual formatted tag (eg. <table>)
A description of what to use the tag for.
You can use these same columns or choose your own.
